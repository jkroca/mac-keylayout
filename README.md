A Mac keyboard layout for spanish/español (latam) keyboards

This project was created in Ukelele v3.5.12 for my personal use, because i couldn't find any layout for my spanish/español keyboard. As i spent several hours working on it, i think it could be useful for someone else. Some layouts worked for most keys, but not all. This project makes my keyboard 100% compatible with Mac.
